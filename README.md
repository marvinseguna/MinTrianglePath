# MinTrianglePath

## Description
Aim of this project was to design an algorithm to find the minimum path from the first node until the nodes in the bottom level. The program accepts input either through command line or through a file and provides an output on screen. Consider the following graph:

						7
					      /  \
					     6	  3
				            /  \ /  \
					   3	8    5
			                  /  \ /  \ /  \
					11    2	  10	9		
			
The Minimum path to traverse the whole graph would be 7+6+3+2 = 18.

## Running the Application
Simply download the Jar file and run "java -jar MinTrianglePath.jar".
